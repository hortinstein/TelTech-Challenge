Currently ranked #10	hortinstein	1,204 Requests per minute...I have noticed that ping is playing a big difference here.  Runs twice as fast on a cloud provider than home computer, but I am also going to figure out where my process is spending most of its time, I cannot seem to get the throughput I was acheiving earlier, unless they rate limited me.

Record requests was 1372 per minute for mine, but I am still having a lot of CPU free.
